- Adopt a functionnal approach as much as possible in the project (rather than OOP) so that tests can be easier to code
- When coding tests for a function, don't try to instanciate App, but call the function you are trying to test directly
- If you want to check the whole project consistency, use "npm run ci"
- Don't try to create commits on your own, let the user handle this
- Don't add accessibility attributes to the DOM, it's not needed for this plugin
