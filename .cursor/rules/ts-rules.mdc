- **Never use any as a type**
- Use debug module instead of console.log to log messages to the console
- When a variable is declared but not used: if it contains a DOM element created with createElement/createEl, keep the creation but remove the variable assignment (e.g., change `const el = parent.createEl('div')` to `parent.createEl('div')` instead of removing the line entirely)
- If there are too many files in a folder, try to split the folder into smaller folders, and update the imports accordingly
- For icons, use the setIcons function (setIcon(parent: HTMLElement, iconId: IconName): void), and the iconId is the name of the icon in the Lucide icon library
- You don't need to run tests or build, simply use the linting to check for errors
